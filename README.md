# QA-PROJECT-2


App Design

I have create an application which uses 4 services to run, This is constructed from the following:

## Frontend
This section is the the section that the user will interact with, I have used this to pull the information from the other 3
services to randomly generate a Skyrim character with stats dependant on the race and gender.

## App-2 
This service choses at random the characters race, this is from a selection of 10 different races which all contribute to the
overall characters stats.

## App-3 
This service is for selecting the characters gender, the choices male and female also effect the overall stats of the character.

## App-4
This service pulls data from both App-2 and App-3 backend services and uses the information to return the stats to the frontend, making it available for the user to see.
